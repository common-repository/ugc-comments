The plugin allows you to manage the values of the &quot;rel&quot; attribute in comment links (&quot;ugc&quot;, &quot;nofollow&quot;).

== Description ==

The plugin allows you to manage the values of the "rel" attribute in comment links. You can enable or disable the &quot;<strong>ugc</strong>&quot; and &quot;<strong>nofollow</strong>&quot; values for all links in comments (separately for the comment author's links and separately for links within the comment).

Help from Google:

<strong>rel=&quot;ugc&quot;</strong>: UGC stands for User Generated Content, and the ugc attribute value is recommended for links within user generated content, such as comments and forum posts.

<strong>rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;</strong>: Use this attribute for cases where you want to link to a page but donâ€™t want to imply any type of endorsement, including passing along ranking credit to another page.

You can read more in the Google [blog](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2019/09/evolving-nofollow-new-ways-to-identify.html).

The plugin's additional features include the ability to hide comment links from Yandex (by inverting them with &lt;!&ndash;&ndash;noindex&ndash;&ndash;&gt;&lt;!&ndash;&ndash;/noindex&ndash;&ndash;&gt; tags).
